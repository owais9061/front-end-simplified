// reduce() Method

//It takes an array and reduces it to a single value.
// A common use case is to get a total of all the values in an array. 
// This would be useful in a shopping cart application.

// reduce() Syntax


reduce(
  function (previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex) {
    /* â€¦ */
  },
  [initialValue]
);

// The callback function that is passed into the `reduce()` method takes three arguments:

// `previousValue` or `accumulator` The value returned from the last time the callback function was called. This is sometimes called the "accumulator".
// `currentValue` The value of the current element being processed in the array.
// `currentIndex` The index of the current element being processed in the array.

// You can also pass in an `initialValue` after the callback function. This is the value to use as the first argument to the first call of the callback function. 
// If no initial value is supplied, the first element in the array will be used.

// Simple Example

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const sum = numbers.reduce(function (accumulator, currentValue) {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // 55

// We could shorten it up to:

const sum2 = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);

console.log(sum2); // 55

const sum4 = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 10);
console.log(sum4); // 65


// If we were to do the same thing using a `for of` loop, it would look like this:

const sum3 = () => {
  let acc = 0;
  for (const curr of numbers) {
    acc += curr;
  }
  return acc;
};

console.log(sum3()); // 55


// Using reduce with objects
// You will most likely be working with objects, so let's look at an example of products 
// where we want to get a sum of all of the `price` properties.

const cart = [
  { name: 'Prooduct 1', price: 130 },
  { name: 'Product 2', price: 150 },
  { name: 'Product 3', price: 175 },
];

const total = cart.reduce(function (accumulator, product) {
  return accumulator + product.price;
}, 0);

console.log(price); // 455


const cart2=[
    {
        product:"TShirt-Yellow-Small",
        price:200,
    },
    {
        product:"TShirt-Yellow-Medium",
        price:200,
    },
    {
        product:"TShirt-Yellow-large",
        price:200,
    }
]

const total2=cart2.reduce(function(acc,curr){
  return acc + cart2.price;
},0)
console.log(total2)
